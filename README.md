<b>Soil Moisture Detection System</b><br>
Developed a soil moisture monitoring system using Arduino Uno, a soil moisture sensor, an LCD
display, and a buzzer. The sensor measures real-time soil water content, which is displayed on the
LCD for continuous monitoring. Implemented threshold-based logic to trigger a buzzer alert when
moisture levels fall below a set value, simulating irrigation alerts for precision agriculture.
